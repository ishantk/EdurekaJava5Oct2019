// MyApp is a class in Java : This is also a Java Program
public class MyApp {
	// main is a block which is executed automatically when we will run this program
	// Whatever we will write in main, will be executed and that too in a sequence i.e. one after another
	// main is a function/method which is executed when we run program
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		// Print Statements : To show data to the User of Program
		// 					  To display informative content we use Print Statements in Program
		System.out.println("This is Awesome");
		System.out.println("This is my First Java Program");
		System.out.println("Thank You :)");

	}

}

// PS: What is class and What is main exactly shall come in our future discussions :)

// In any Program we have certain instructions
// 1. Read/Print    Statements/Instructions
// 2. Creational    Statements/Instructions
// 3. Computational Statements/Instructions
